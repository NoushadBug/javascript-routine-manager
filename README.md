<h1 align="center">  jsRoutineManager</h1>
This is my personal tool (kind of fun project) made by javascript which populates the routine and filters it according to the date and time.
<br>
<p>
It has - 
* auto filtering system by date and day
* countdowns the upcoming class time
* you can set alarm; it will ring whenever you are running out of your classtime
* other filtering options
* handy tool
* funky simple UI
